 Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are generative models that transform random samples from one distribution to another. GANs have several applications:
- Generate Examples for Image Datasets
- Generate Human Face Photos
- Generate Realistic Photos
- Generate Cartoon Characters
- Image-to-Image Translation
- Text-to-Image Translation
- Front-End Face Generation
- Generate New Human Poses

### Pustaka üîç
- pandas --> for managing the data.
-numpy --> for mathematical operations.
- sklearn --> for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
- seaborn --> for visualizing the data.
- matplotlib --> for additional plotting tools.
- keras --> for loading datasets.
- tensorflow --> for machine learning and neural network related functions.

### Objectives üßê
- Understand the original formulation of GANs, and their two separately trained networks: Generator and Discriminator
- Implement GANs on simulated and real datasets
- Apply DCGANs to a dataset
- Understand how to train DCGANs
- Generate an image using a DCGAN
- Understand how changing the input of the latent space of DCGANs changes the generated image

### Conclusion
DCGAN technology is a great choice for large-scale, high-quality anime character creation. With its efficient pipeline and ability to automatically generate unique images, DCGAN is very useful in creative industries, such as games or other visual applications, where character creation requires large variations but short production times.
